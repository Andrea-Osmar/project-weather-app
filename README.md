# Weather App ☀ ☔ 🌤

The aim of this week's project was to create a simple weather app with data from Open weather API. The app should show today's weather and five day forecast.

## The problem ❔

The challenge for this week was to work with APi's and how to understand the data that was fetched. I need to push my knowledge in javascript.
I chose to create my own design instead of the designs provided and I used both css and javascript to make the site look the way I wanted.

If I had more time I would have added some animations and made the site more responsive.
